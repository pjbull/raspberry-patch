## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build a working cluster with Raspberry Pis. 
The Raspberry Pis are not very powerful and thus, our cluster is
not suitable for serious scientific computing applications.
However, the ability to build a cluster for less than the price of 
many desktop computers allows programmers to test parallel codes
before deploying them to more expensive clusters.

The other goal is to gain experience managing a cluster in order to better
understand how parallel computing works. Installing all of the right software
across multiple compute nodes is a mundane task and yet it is essential for
parallel computing.
